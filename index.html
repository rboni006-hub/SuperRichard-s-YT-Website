     <h1>Mod Ideas</h1>
     <p>I have a couple ideas for mods based off of vs Impostor mods but with my own characters and unique storylines!, Others are just characters that do not have a mod yet, my OC's, or an actually good Plants Vs Zombies mod.</p>

     <h2>Friday Night Mongin'</h2>
     <p>A mod based off of the after scenes of Finale v4 in vs Impostor.</p>
     <p>The characters inside the mod would be me and my cousins oc's, as shown in this video.<a href="" alt="a vid of me and my cousins among us oc's sprites">This video</a></p>
    <p>And also a blast from Black's past where his first allie comes to snap him out of the parasite he is in.(plus other bonus freeplay songs)</p>
    <h2>Super Night Funkin'</h2>
    <p>A mod where my normal OC's have to deal with a new enemy in the ring, bf and gf have suddenly apeared out of their home universe after [!a#*^@???@_6???] destroyed it, so now they will have to find a way out, <strong>or else.</strong></p>
    <p>This mod (<em>might</em>) contain a week for each character and some covers in freeplay</p>

    <h2>Vs PvZ</h2>
    <p>An actually normal PvZ mod since Plants Vs Rappers, the story will have 6 weeks based on Day, Night, Pool, Fog, Roof, and an Extra suprise week if you can find it, And a extra <em>extra</em> song in freeplay.</p>
    <p>Characters you will rap against</p>
    <ol>Peashooter</ol>
    <ol>Sunflower</ol>
    <ol>Crazy Dave</ol>
    <ol>Newspaper zombie</ol>
    <ol>Cattail</ol>
    <ol>Yeti Zombie</ol>
    <ol>Melon pult</ol>
    <ol>Dr. Zomboss</ol>
    <ol>Buckethead Zombie</ol>
    


    <h1>Animation ideas.</h1>
    <p>Let's be honest, everything is hard to animate at some point. BUT NOT AS HARD AS GETTING SOME GOOD IDEAS!!!! So, I will take out polls and leave a suggestion box for people who want me to animate something(Don't worry, i'll give you credit) So just leave them here in the box below!</p>
   <form> <input type="text" name="typeidea" placeholder="type idea" required>
          <button type="submit">Submit</button></form>
